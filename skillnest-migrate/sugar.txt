A finance ministry considers a per-unit tax on sugary beverages to reduce obesity-related health costs and raise revenue.

Market research suggests demand for branded colas is price-elastic in urban areas with many substitutes, but more inelastic in rural regions with limited alternatives.

Retailers warn pass-through could differ between supermarkets and kirana shops; producers raise reformulation costs and timing.

Public-health advocates expect lower sugar consumption if the tax is salient on shelf labels and paired with information campaigns.
